<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Week Three Discussion Notes</h1>

</div>


<div id="the-axioms-of-probability-theory" class="section level1">
<h1>The Axioms of Probability Theory</h1>
<p>There are three statements typically taken to be the axioms of
probability theory:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>[Normalization] The probability of any tautology is
1:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(P(\top) = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>[Non-Negativity] The probability of any proposition is
greater than or equal to 0.</strong> That is, for any <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(A) \geq
0\)</span></li>
<li><strong>[Additivity] The probability of the disjunction of two
mutually exclusive propositions is the sum of their
probabilities.</strong> That is, for mutually exclusive <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(A \lor
B) = P(A) + P(B)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>These axioms stipulate what a function <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> must satisfy, in order for it to count
as a representation of probability. For our purposes, these axioms are
foundational truths; if we encounter a function which violates any one
of these axioms, then it is not relevant to probability theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="consequences-of-the-axioms" class="section level1">
<h1>Consequences of the Axioms</h1>
<p><strong>(Formula for Contradictions)</strong> Immediately from the
axioms, we can show that contradictions are to be assigned probability
0. Here is a quick proof (no need to memorize the proof; the point here
is to show that from just three axioms, we can derive many of the other
properties which we think that probabilities should do). We start with
the fact that the probability of any tautology is 1: <span
class="math display">\[
P(\top) = 1
\]</span> We know that if a tautology is one of the disjuncts of the
disjunction, then the disjunction itself is a tautology (that is, if X
is always true, then the statement “either X or Y” will also always be
true). Therefore, by the axiom of normalization: <span
class="math display">\[
P(\top \lor \perp) = 1
\]</span> We then note that any tautology <span
class="math inline">\(\top\)</span> is mutually exclusive with any
contradiction <span class="math inline">\(\perp\)</span>. Hence, by the
axiom of additivity: <span class="math display">\[
P(\top \lor \perp) = P(\top) + P(\perp)
\]</span> Putting all the pieces together we get: <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
1 = 1 + P(\perp) \implies P(\perp) = 0
\end{align}
\]</span> <strong>(Formula for Negated Propositions)</strong> The next
very important consequence of the axioms is a negation rule. It tells us
what the probability of the negation of a proposition is, given that we
know the probability of the un-negated proposition. That is: <span
class="math display">\[
P(\sim A) = 1 - P(A)
\]</span> The proof for this statement is similar to the one just
proved.</p>
<p><strong>(General Formula for Disjunction)</strong> Another
consequence of the axioms is an equation for any disjunction. The
additivity axiom gives us an equation for the disjunction of mutually
exclusive propositions. This equation tells us what the probability of
any disjunction of statements is: <span class="math display">\[
P(A \lor B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \&amp; B)
\]</span> There is an algebraic proof of this which is not too
difficult, but which would lengthen this note unnecessarily. In any
case, the algebraic proof just follows the intuition which one would get
from the pictoral representation of what is going on here. What we want
is an equation for the light-blue shaded area, which represents <span
class="math inline">\(P(A \lor B)\)</span>:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20A%20or%20B.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>To get started, we add up the area within the A circle (shaded teal
blue) which represents <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> and the
area within the B circle (shaded red) which represents <span
class="math inline">\(P(B)\)</span>. When we do this, we see that we are
left with a section which is shaded both neon blue and red, resulting in
a dark blue. This dark blue area represents <span
class="math inline">\(P(A \&amp; B)\)</span>. The dark blue color, means
that we “double counted” this area. To fix this, we just subtract out
the <span class="math inline">\(A \&amp; B\)</span> area. That is, we
subtract out <span class="math inline">\(P(A \&amp; B)\)</span>
once.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20A%20or%20B%202.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>So, we end up with the equation: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
P(A \lor B) &amp;= \text{teal blue} + \text{red} - \text{dark blue}\\
&amp;= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \&amp; B)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="conditional-probability" class="section level1">
<h1>Conditional Probability</h1>
<p>When considering conditional probabilities, we are interested in the
probability of some proposition <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
being true given that we know that some other proposition <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is true. We use <span
class="math inline">\(P(A | B)\)</span> to mean the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> conditional on <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> being true. It is defined to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\&amp; B)}{P(B)}
\]</span> This definition turns out to make sense for many reasons.
However, for now, let us just treat this as stipulated.</p>
<p>Conditional probability is tied up with the notion of
<strong>independence</strong>. Two propositions, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, are independent just in case <span
class="math inline">\(P(A | B) = P(A)\)</span>. With this definition of
independence, we can prove two equations for conjunctions of
propositions.</p>
<p><strong>(Formula for Independent Conjuncts)</strong> Given that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are independent then by the definition
of conditional probabilities, we have: <span class="math display">\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\&amp; B)}{P(B)} \implies P(A) = \frac{P(A\&amp;
B)}{P(B)}
\]</span> Which then implies: <span class="math display">\[
P(A \&amp; B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\]</span> It is crucial to note here that this is not true for any <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. It is only true for propositions which
are independent of one another.</p>
<p><strong>(Formula for Conjunction)</strong> One general formula for
the conjunction of any two propositions can be quickly obtained though.
We note from the definition of conditional probabilities that: <span
class="math display">\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \&amp; B)}{P(B)}
\]</span> It then follows that: <span class="math display">\[
P(A \&amp; B ) = P(A | B) \times P(B)
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="example-two-four-sided-dice" class="section level1">
<h1>Example: Two Four-Sided Dice</h1>
<p>Suppose we have two fair four-sided die and we roll both of them. Let
us first think about how we might represent all the possible outcomes of
rolling both die. We could list out all the possibilities. Dice one may
result in a 1 and dice two may result in a 1; dice one may result in a 2
and dice two may result in a 1… This can go on for a while. Often, in
mathematics, finding a representation of a given situation can be very
useful for conceptualizing a problem; however, finding such a
representation is also often the hard aspect of a problem. Thankfully,
the following representation will work for us:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleOne.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>Here, each square represents a possible outcome. For example, the
green square represents the outcome where the first die results in 2 and
the second die also results in 2. The lavender square represents the
outcome where the first die results in 3 and the second die results in
4.</p>
<p>Now since the two dice are fair, that means that all the outcomes are
equiprobable (having equal probability). So suppose we want to know what
the probability of getting 2 on the first die and 3 on the second die
is. We shall represent this as asking, what is the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(P(\langle 2,3\rangle)\)</span>? Let us first
highlight which outcome this is:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleOne%202.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>Since each box represents the outcome of rolling both dice and each
outcome is equiprobable, we can figure out what the probability of
getting <span class="math inline">\(\langle 2,3\rangle\)</span> is by
counting how many boxes the event of getting <span
class="math inline">\(\langle 2,3\rangle\)</span> takes up and divide
that by the total number of boxes. We see that the event <span
class="math inline">\(\langle 2,3\rangle\)</span> only takes up 1 box,
and there are 16 boxes in total. Therefore: <span
class="math display">\[
P(\langle 2,3\rangle) = \frac{1}{16}
\]</span> Let us think about a more difficult question. What is the
probability that the first die results in a 2? Well, let us look at all
the outcomes in which the first die does result in 2.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleOne%203.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>Here we see that the event “dice one results in 2” takes up 4 boxes.
Again, since each outcome is equiprobable, we find the probability of
dice one resulting in 2 by counting the number of boxes which it takes
up and divide by the total number of boxes. In this case, we get: <span
class="math display">\[
P(\text{D1 = 2}) = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
\]</span> Finally, let us consider the situation in which we are
interested in the sum of the results of the two dice. For instance, we
might want to know, what is the probability that the two dice results
have a sum of 6. Again, let us find the outcomes in which the results
have a sum of 6:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleOne%204.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>We see that the event of the two dice having a sum of 6 takes up only
3 boxes. Therefore, due to the same reasoning as before, we have: <span
class="math display">\[
P(\text{sum of dice }=6) = \frac{3}{16}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="example-a-small-deck-of-cards" class="section level1">
<h1>Example: A Small Deck of Cards</h1>
<p>Consider a “deck” of cards consisting of only eight cards:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleTwo.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>Here, we have two “d” cards, two “h” cards, two “c” cards and two “s”
cards. Let us suppose that when we draw from this deck that we have an
equal chance of drawing any one of the cards. Hence, for example, since
there are eight cards in total, the probability of drawing a “c” card
is: <span class="math display">\[
P(c) = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]</span> Because there are 2 “c” cards and 8 cards in total.</p>
<p>Now, what is the probability of drawing a “d” card on the first draw,
putting that card back into the deck (i.e., with replacement), and then
drawing an “s” card? We can represent the possible outcomes of two draws
as follows:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleTwo2%20.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>Here we have a “tree” representation of the possible outcomes. I
haven’t drawn the middle “branches” for the “h” and “c” scenarios as it
gets too crowded. Just know that there should be four branches extending
from those letters as well. I have also made use of the fact that we do
not really care, in this particular question, about which “d” or “c” or
“h” or “s” card we pick. Hence the probability of picking a card of any
type (“d”, “c”, “h”, or “s”) is <span
class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span>. Starting from the left hand side, we
see that for our first draw we have four possibilities. We have a <span
class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> chance of drawing a “d”, a <span
class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> chance of drawing an “h”, and so on.
Suppose that on our first draw we get an “s”. Then we are here on the
tree:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleTwo%203%20.png"
width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>From there, there are four possibilities for our second draw each
having probability of <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span>. Now, if
we want to know the probability of getting a “c” putting it back and
then getting an “h”, what we should do is look at the probability of
ending up here:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleTwo%204.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>To calculate this, we look at the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(P(s_2 \&amp; d_1)\)</span>. Here I have
subscripted the letters (subscripting means putting little numbers next
to the letters) in order to indicate which draw it is. For instance,
<span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> means getting an <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> on the second draw. If we were
interested in higher numbers of draws, we may write say <span
class="math inline">\(c_5\)</span> for getting a <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> on the fifth draw. In this case, <span
class="math inline">\(s_2 \&amp; d_1\)</span> corresponds to the single
branch:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleTwo%205.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>Since each branch is equiprobable (everything has the same number
<span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> written over it), we can simply
count how many branches there are in total. If you count them all
(including the ones I have not drawn for “h” and “c”), there are 16
total branches. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(P(s_2 \&amp; d_1)
= 1/16\)</span>. [Note that if you use the equation for conjunctions
(that is, <span class="math inline">\(P(A\&amp;B) = P(A|B)P(B)\)</span>,
you will get the same answer; here I use intuition and the power of a
good representation to just answer the question directly)].</p>
<p>Now what about the situation in which we first draw a “d” and then
draw an “s” but we do not put the “d” back into the deck (i.e., without
replacement). Here, we need to change our representation. Note that I
only draw the top of the tree here with the “d” branch:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Pictures/Week%203%20ExampleTwo%206.png" width="350" /></p>
</center>
<p>The crucial change is that having first drawn the “d” card, since we
do not replace it in the deck, there are now only 7 cards in total. So
the probabilities change. Now, we still want to know what <span
class="math inline">\(P(s_2 \&amp; d_1)\)</span> is. Here, we need to
use the equation: <span class="math display">\[
P(s_2 \&amp; d_1) = P(s_2|d_1)P(d_1)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P(s_2|d_1) = 2/7\)</span>
(how do we know this? look at the tree! It tells us that given that
<span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> has already occurred, the
probability of getting to <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(2/7\)</span>. This is why the tree
representation is so useful) and <span class="math inline">\(P(d_1) =
1/4\)</span>. Therefore: <span class="math display">\[
P(s_2 \&amp; d_1) = \frac{2}{7}\times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{28} =
\frac{1}{14}
\]</span></p>
