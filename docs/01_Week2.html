</div>


<div id="what-is-a-proposition" class="section level1">
<h1>What is a Proposition?</h1>
<p>The question which heads this section is actually one which is
debated amongst some philosophers (primarily, philosophers of language).
For this course, we will not be delving into these debates. For our
purposes, propositions are what is expressed by a special kind of
sentence. What kind of sentence? Well, there are a number of
<em>different</em> ways to pick out these special kinds of sentences.
Here are three different characterizations of propositions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Propositions are the sentences which can be true or false.</li>
<li>Propositions are the sentences which we can believe to be true or
false.</li>
<li>Propositions are the sentences which purport to describe the way
things are.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these three different characterizations, there are three
different tests which we may use to diagnose whether or not a sentence
expresses a proposition.</p>
<p>The first test is the “can it be true or false”-test. Given a
sentence, if it makes sense to ask whether or not that sentence is true
or false, then that sentence expresses a proposition. For example,
consider the sentence “France is west of Germany”. Does the question “Is
it true or false that France is west of Germany?” make sense? In this
case, it does. Hence, it expresses a proposition.</p>
<p>The second test is the “I believe”-test. Given a sentence X, if it
makes sense to say “I believe X” or “I believe that X” then X expresses
a proposition. For example, consider the sentence “Willard made a mess
today”. Does the sentence “I believe that Willard made a mess today”
make sense? In this case, it does, Hence, it expresses a
proposition.</p>
<p>The third test relies more on intuition. Given a sentence, we may ask
whether or not that sentence purports to say that the world is some way.
For example, consider the sentence “Electrons have negative charge”.
Does that sentence say that the world is some way? Yes! Hence, it is a
proposition.</p>
<p>What are some sentences which do not express propositions? Well, one
common class of sentences are imperatives (also known as commands). For
example, consider the sentence “Close the door!”. How does such a
sentence fare against our three tests? For the “can it be true or
false”-test, we want to know whether or not it makes sense to ask “It is
true or false that close the door”. It does not! For the “I
believe”-test, we want to know whether or not it makes sense to say “I
believe that close the door”. Again, it does not. Finally, with the
third test, we can just intuitively ask ourselves whether or not the
sentence “close the door!” purports to say that the world is a certain
way. It certainly expresses that we desire someone to close the door,
but it does not say that the door is in fact closed. Hence, it fails the
third test as well.</p>
<p>Another class of sentences which do not express propositions, are
questions. Try the tests on the sentence “Can you please pass the
salt?”. You should come to the conclusion that such a sentence fails all
three tests.</p>
<p>It is crucial that you understand that just because a sentence
expresses a proposition does not mean that it is actually the case that
the sentence is true. The sentence “Humans have larger brains than blue
whales” expresses a proposition, but is false.</p>
</div>
<div id="building-more-complex-propositions" class="section level1">
<h1>Building More Complex Propositions</h1>
<p>Given some sentences which express propositions, we can build more
complex sentences which also express propositions.</p>
<p><strong>(Conjunction)</strong> Let us use the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> for sentences and the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\&amp;\)</span> for either “and” or “but”. Then
given that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> express propositions, then <span
class="math inline">\(A \&amp; B\)</span> expresses a proposition.</p>
<p>Consider the sentences “1 + 2 = 5” and “It is sunny today”. Both
express propositions (check for yourself!). We can build a more complex
sentence using the conjunct “and” or “but”: “1 + 2 = 5 and it is sunny
today” or “1 + 2 = 5 but it is sunny today”. Of course, these sound like
weird sentences to say out of context but they are still sensible. For
example, suppose that your friend asked you what the sum of 1 and 2 is
and what the weather is like outside. If your arithmetic is
<em>really</em> bad then you may very well say “1 + 2 = 5 and it is
sunny today”.</p>
<p><strong>(Disjunction)</strong> We continue to use capital letters
like <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> for sentences. We shall use the symbol
<span class="math inline">\(\lor\)</span> for “or” or “either… or…”.
Then given that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> express propositions, then <span
class="math inline">\(A \lor B\)</span> expresses a proposition.</p>
<p>Consider the sentences “The coin comes up heads” and “The coin comes
up tails”. Again, these both express propositions. We can build a more
complex sentence using the disjunct “or” or “either… or…”. For example,
“Either the coin comes up heads or the coin comes up tails” is a
sentence expressing a proposition.</p>
<p><strong>(Negation)</strong> Let us use <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> as our symbol for negation “not” or
“It is not the case that…”. Then given that <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> expresses proposition, <span
class="math inline">\(\sim A\)</span> expresses a proposition as
well.</p>
<p>Consider the sentence “Humans have souls”. This sentence expresses a
proposition. We can build a more complex sentence by negating the
sentence with “It is not the case that…”. For example, “It is not the
case that humans have souls” is a sentence which expresses a
proposition. Sometimes, the negation phrase may end up in the middle of
the sentence, as in “Humans do not have souls”.</p>
</div>
<div id="properties-of-propositions" class="section level1">
<h1>Properties of Propositions</h1>
<p><strong>(Tautology)</strong> A proposition expressed by a sentence is
a tautology just in case it must be true (it is impossible for it to be
false).</p>
<p>Consider the sentence “Either it is sunny or it is not sunny”. Is is
possible for this sentence to be false? No. Therefore, the proposition
expressed by this sentence is a tautology.</p>
<p>Often, we can assess whether or not a proposition is a tautology
without even considering what the sentence says. All we need to look at
are the <span class="math inline">\(\&amp;, \lor\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> symbols which occur in the
proposition when we represent it symbolically. For example, the sentence
“Either it is raining or it is not raining” may be represented as <span
class="math inline">\(A \lor \sim A\)</span>. In fact, on reflection,
you should recognize that any sentence which can be represented in the
form of <span class="math inline">\(A \lor \sim A\)</span> is a
tautology.</p>
<p><strong>(Contradiction)</strong> A proposition expressed by a
sentence is a contradiction just in case it must be false (it is
impossible for it to be true).</p>
<p>Consider the sentence “The dice roll resulted in 4 and that same dice
roll resulted in 1”. Is this possible? Can this sentence ever be true?
Given that we are in our ordinary world, the dice roll can only result
in one number, hence it is impossible. Therefore, it is a
contradiction.</p>
<p>Again, just by considering the symbols, we can assess whether or not
a proposition is a contradiction. For example, the sentence “The
envelope is opened and the envelope is not opened” may be represented as
<span class="math inline">\(A \&amp; \sim A\)</span>. Again, on
reflection, you should recognize that every sentence which can be
represented in this form is a sentence which expresses a
contradiction.</p>
<p><strong>[Note]</strong> If you are interested in how we can assess
whether or not a proposition (or a collection of propositions) is a
tautology or contradiction without considering their content, then take
LPS 30 (Introduction to Symbolic Logic).</p>
<p><strong>(Mutually Exclusive)</strong> Two propositions are mutually
exclusive just in case it is impossible for both propositions to be true
concurrently.</p>
<p>Consider the sentences “Rudolf’s first single draw was the Ace of
Spades” and “Rudolf’s first single draw was the Jack of Hearts”. Is it
possible for both sentences to be true at the same time? No. The Ace of
Spaces is not the Jack of Hearts.</p>
<p>Unlike, with tautologies and contradictions, it is not in general,
possible to ascertain whether or not two propositions are mutually
exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>(Partition)</strong> A collection of propositions form a
partition just in case it is impossible any two of the propositions in
the collection to be true concurrently (this is just mutually
exclusivity but for more than two propositions) and at least one of the
propositions in the collection must be true (this is called
exhaustivity).</p>
<p>For example, consider a four sided die. Then consider the following
sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nelson’s first roll was a 1</li>
<li>Nelson’s first roll was a 2</li>
<li>Nelson’s first roll was a 3</li>
<li>Nelson’s first roll was a 4</li>
</ul>
<p>If we consider any two of these sentences, they cannot be true at the
same time. And given that we know that Nelson did roll this four sided
die, at least one of these propositions is true.</p>
